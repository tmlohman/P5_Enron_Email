1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]

	The goal of this project is to use supervised machine learning to build a classifier for persons of interest in the Enron case. Persons of interest (POI) are identified as people who who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. The data comes from the Enron Email Dataset, which was prepared by the CALO Project/MIT and is accessible here (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/). 

	The dataset includes approximately 0.5M emails from Enron employees, as well as a financial dataset including such values as salary, stock options, bonus, etc. There are 146 people included in the data set, 18 of whom are identified as POI.  I wrote a couple of functions in the explore_enron_data.py file to calculate basic statistics and identify any outliers for each numerical feature. After removing the totals, I defined as outliers as more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean. The code also marks which outliers are POIs. I counted how many times each person appeared as an outlier. Unsurprisingly, Ken Lay is the most frequent outlier at 8 appearances; Jeff Skilling, Mark Frevert, and John Lavorato tie for second at 5 outliers each. At first glance it appears that POIs are more likely to be outliers than non-POIs, so I may use this as a feature moving forward.
	

2. What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importances of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.  [relevant rubric items: “create new features”, “properly scale features”, “intelligently select feature”]

	The new feature I chose to add was the number of times each person appears as an outlier in the numerical fields. To implement this, I defined an outlier as more than two standard deviations from the mean, found the outliers for each numerical feature, and added the counts as a new feature (outlier_count). I chose this as a feature because it stood out in my initial data exploration, and I wanted to see if it improve the accuracy of my classifier. As a first test, I ran a naive bayes classifier with the default parameters using the poi and salary features. When I added the outlier_count as a feature, it raised the accuracy from 69% to 87%.
	
	I wanted to compare the relative importance of outlier_count to the other possible features in the dataset. So I ran SelectKBest on all the numerical features and got the following results:
		bonus 30.6522823057
		salary 15.8060900874
		total_stock_value 10.814634863
		shared_receipt_with_poi 10.6697373596
		exercised_stock_options 9.95616758208
		total_payments 8.962715501
		deferred_income 8.49349703055
		outlier_count 8.35610397946
		restricted_stock 8.051101897
		long_term_incentive 7.53452224003
		loan_advances 7.03793279819
		from_poi_to_this_person 4.93930363951
		expenses 4.31439557308
		other 3.19668450433
		to_messages 2.60677186644
		director_fees 1.64109792617
		restricted_stock_deferred 0.679280338952
		from_messages 0.434625706635
		from_this_person_to_poi 0.105897968337
		deferral_payments 0.00981944641905
	My new variable, outlier_count, ranks 8th among all the features. It also appears that there are sharp dropoffs in feature importance - the first occuring between the 2nd and 3rd features, and the second occuring between the 11th and 12th. 

	
3. What algorithm did you end up using? What other one(s) did you try? How did model performance differ between algorithms?  [relevant rubric item: “pick an algorithm”]

	Before tuning my algorithm, I ran naive bayes, SVM, and decision tree using the default parameters, and got the following performance metrics:
	Naive Bayes: Accuracy: 0.74713	Precision: 0.23578	Recall: 0.40000	F1: 0.29668	F2: 0.35109
	SVM: Precision or recall may be undefined due to a lack of true positive predicitons.
	Decision Tree: Accuracy: 0.79513	Precision: 0.22360	Recall: 0.21700	F1: 0.22025	F2: 0.21829
	
	Using default parameters, decision tree achieved the best accuracy. However, naive bayes did better on all other metrics. SVM threw an error and did not produce any performance metrics at all. Based on these results. I plan to move forward with naive bayes and improve it through feature selection and scaling. If I am unable to achieve the desired performance this way, I may got back and look at decision tree as another option.

4. What does it mean to tune the parameters of an algorithm, and what can happen if you don’t do this well?  How did you tune the parameters of your particular algorithm? (Some algorithms do not have parameters that you need to tune -- if this is the case for the one you picked, identify and briefly explain how you would have done it for the model that was not your final choice or a different model that does utilize parameter tuning, e.g. a decision tree classifier).  [relevant rubric item: “tune the algorithm”]

	Tuning the parameters of an algortihm means adjusting certain rules to achieve the best outcome. The naive bayes classifier does not have any parameters, so in this case the only tuning I could do was to adjust the k value for SelectKBest. I did this using the gridsearch library. Gridsearch runs the provided algorithm for every possible case provided, and returns the best possible classifier. "Best" is defined either using the default scoring function, or by the user. I experimented with some different scoring functions and got the following outputs:
		Default: k = 1, Accuracy: 0.84240	Precision: 0.31909	Recall: 0.16050	F1: 0.21357	F2: 0.17821
		Optimize for precision: k = 6, Accuracy: 0.83787	Precision: 0.37050	Recall: 0.30900	F1: 0.33697	F2: 0.31961
		Optimize for recall: k = 9, Accuracy: 0.83353	Precision: 0.34894	Recall: 0.28700	F1: 0.31495	F2: 0.29756
	For the goals of this project, optimizing for precision produces the best output and is the only model that meets the criteria of accuracy and precision > 0.3.
